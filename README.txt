1) For code execution , use command : python External_megesort.py
2) Please make sure the folder containing the code contains nothing more than the file External_megesort.py  each time the code is executed as the same files will be everwritten causing erroneous results.
3) For case1 when main memory size is large enough to accomodate all the runs , a file named final will consist of the final sorted list.
4)For case2 when main memory size is not large enough to accomodate all the runs , a file with largest count with an 'a' final will consist of the final sorted list.Since same MM blocks are being used to load and sort again and again , main memory file will be erased after use for loading again.
5)Since python has no as such pointers so i didnot find any need to append the name of next file to previous file for scans or access.
